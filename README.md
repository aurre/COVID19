# COVID-19
This project it's to show the impact of a pandemic caused by a virus in 2020.
The reason why a lot of people were affected in so many ways, so we were forced to stay home
for our own good and not keep spreading the virus to others. Also while in quarantine
I was looking for things to do so I decided to put some statistics together.
